# TicTacToe

###Overview
* I will use a two-dimensional array to represent a Tic Tac Toe board, and implement the basic functionality of the game.

* We have two players with alternating turns,who will insert their symbol (X or O) into a specific location on the 3 x 3 grid. If a player gets 3 in a row they win.

* The first player is prompted to decide between X or O as their mark. 
* The players are then prompted to insert their mark (X or O) on the game board.
* The players are shown the board after each move.
* Players are not allowed to place a mark on a already occupied spot.
* The game is over when either of the players places their marks in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.
